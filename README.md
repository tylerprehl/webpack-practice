# Webpack Practice
Webpack is confusing! While working on another project for The Odin Project, it was recommended I start using webpack, but I couldn't quite get it to work as expected.

To help resolve the issue, I decided it would be best to start from scratch in a different repo to practice with webpack and see if I could get the goal of the project (using JS modules) working as expected.
